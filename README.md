# Data Visualization of the Palestinian Conflicts and Humanitarian Crisis

## Abstract

Our website is dedicated to providing insightful data visualizations on the Palestinian conflicts and humanitarian crisis from October 2023 to April 2024. Focusing on the Gaza Strip and West Bank, we present detailed visualizations of conflict-related events and fatalities, analyze commodity prices in Palestine compared to Europe, and highlight critical water quality and availability issues.

Through interactive maps, time-series charts, and comparative infographics, we aim to offer a clear, unbiased depiction of these pressing issues, fostering a deeper understanding and encouraging informed dialogue and action.
